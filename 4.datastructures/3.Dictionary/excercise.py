# Create a dictionary named employee_directory that holds information about multiple employees. The key should be the employee's ID (e.g., EMP001, EMP002, etc.), and the value should be another dictionary containing the employee's name, age, department, and position.

# Add at least 3 employees to the directory.

# Write functions to:

# Add a new employee to the directory.
# Update an employee's details (e.g., update the age or position).
# Remove an employee from the directory using their ID.
# Print the details of an employee using their ID.
# Print the entire employee directory at the end to check the final state.
